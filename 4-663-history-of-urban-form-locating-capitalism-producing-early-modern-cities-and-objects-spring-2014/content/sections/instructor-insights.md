Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _4.663 History of Urban Form: Locating Capitalism: Producing Early Modern Cities and Objects_ as it was taught by Lauren Jacobi in Spring 2014.

This seminar-format class explores major topics and themes concerning interconnections between early modern artistic and architectural creation and the economy. Core course themes include: commodification, production, and consumption, using case studies of the impact of the mercantile economy on chapels; palaces; prints and paintings, and their replication; and other material objects, including coins.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   To address the manufacturing and object life-history of late medieval and Renaissance goods, especially art and architectural creations, with questions about the economy and its interpretation in mind
*   To discuss theories and notions of credit and debt in relation to cultural production
*   To engage in strong student-driven research projects

_Below, Lauren Jacobi shares insights about evaluating student learning in _4.663 History of Urban Form: Locating Capitalism: Producing Early Modern Cities and Objects_._

I believe there are myriad ways to evaluate how students are engaging with course material. Two approaches I favor are 1) to let them present material in class, so that I can attempt to understand what resonates with them, where there may be comprehension issues, etc.; and 2) to carefully read written material that they submit, especially their response papers. Along that line, it can help to ask to see revisions, or have revisions built into the grading structure. It is also critical too, I feel, to generate dialogue in class that measures how students are responding to the way material is being conveyed.
